## ✨ What is PredictOS?

Prediction markets are having their moment. With platforms like **Kalshi** and **Polymarket** opening up their APIs to the public, there's now unprecedented access to real-time market data, order books, and trading capabilities. But raw API access is just the beginning — what's been missing is a unified framework that lets anyone tap into this new financial primitive.

> 💡 **Jupiter Support:** We also support [Jupiter prediction markets](https://jup.ag/prediction) since they're built on Kalshi events — just paste a Jupiter URL and PredictOS will analyze the underlying Kalshi market.

**PredictOS is that framework.**

### 🔓 Why Open Source?

Sure, there are hosted tools out there. But here's the problem:

- **Your data isn't yours.** Every query, every strategy signal, every trade you analyze — it all flows through their servers. Your alpha becomes their alpha. Your edge gets commoditized the moment you share it with a third party.

- **Your strategy isn't private.** Want to build a custom trading bot with proprietary signals? Maybe you've got insider domain knowledge, a unique data source, or a thesis nobody else is running. The moment you plug that into a hosted platform, you've handed over your playbook.

- **You can't customize what you don't own.** Need a specific feature? Want to integrate your own AI model? Good luck submitting a feature request and waiting 6 months.

With PredictOS, **you own everything**. Run it on your own infrastructure. Fork it. Modify it. Build your secret sauce without anyone watching. Your strategies stay yours. Your data never leaves your servers. And when you find an edge, you keep it.

---

PredictOS is an open-source, AI-powered operating system for prediction markets. It provides a unified interface to analyze markets across platforms, delivering real-time AI insights to help you find alpha opportunities and make informed trading decisions.

Whether you're a casual trader looking for quick market analysis or a power user building automated betting strategies with proprietary data, PredictOS gives you the tools to navigate prediction markets — on your own terms.

**What's next?** We're building towards a complete prediction market toolkit: automated betting bots, whale tracking, copytrading, cross-platform arbitrage, and more. See the [Coming Soon](#-coming-soon) section for the full roadmap.

## 🧠 Introducing Predict Super Intelligence: PredictOS V2 Release

**Predict Super Intelligence** represents the next evolution of PredictOS — a powerful multi-agent AI system that enables intelligent, team-like analysis and execution across prediction markets.

### The Vision

Traditional market analysis tools give you a single perspective. Predict Super Intelligence breaks this paradigm by custom-bulding **multiple AI agents** and making them work together, each bringing unique capabilities, tools, and models to form a comprehensive market view.

### How It Works

Predict Super Intelligence operates through a sophisticated **agent pipeline**:

1. **Predict Agents** — Deploy one or more AI agents (using xAI Grok or OpenAI GPT models -- Gemini coming in future releases) to independently analyze prediction markets. Each agent can be equipped with different tools (X Search, Web Search, Polyfactual Research) and custom commands to focus their analysis.

2. **Predict Bookmaker Agent** — When multiple agents complete their analysis, the Bookmaker Agent acts as a "judge" that synthesizes all perspectives, weighs agreements and disagreements, and produces a consolidated recommendation with consensus metrics.

3. **Mapper Agent** — Translates analysis outputs into platform-specific order parameters ready for execution.

### Two Modes of Operation

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **🔍 Supervised** | Agents analyze the market and provide recommendations. User reviews the analysis and can execute via OkBet one-click links. | Research, learning, manual trading |
| **⚡ Autonomous** | Agents analyze the market and automatically execute trades based on recommendations (within your budget limits). Currently, single Polymarket market is supported. Batch market + Kalshi coming soon. | Automated trading, hands-off execution |

### Key Features

- **Multi-Model Support** — Mix and match xAI Grok (4.1, 4) and OpenAI GPT (5.2, 5.1, 4.1) models
- **Tool-Augmented Analysis** — Agents can use X (Twitter) search, Web search, Polyfactual deep research, and x402/PayAI sellers
- **Custom Commands** — Direct agent focus with natural language instructions
- **Real-Time Pipeline Visualization** — Watch agents work through the analysis pipeline
- **Consensus Metrics** — See how agents agree or disagree on recommendations
- **Budget Controls** — Set strict limits for autonomous execution (\$1-\$100)
- **🛡️ Verifiable Agents** — Permanently store agent analysis on [Irys](https://irys.xyz/) blockchain for transparent, verifiable AI predictions

> 💡 **Extensibility:** New agents and features are added as Edge Functions under `supabase/functions/<feature-name>/` with shared logic in `_shared/`. The modular architecture allows mixing different AI providers, tools, and execution strategies.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started) v1.0+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local Supabase)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PredictionXBT/PredictOS.git
cd PredictOS
```

### 2. Start the Backend (Supabase)

```bash
# Navigate to supabase directory
cd supabase

# Copy environment template and add your API keys
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with the credentials required for the features you want to use:

> 📖 **Feature-specific setup guides:**
> - **Super Intelligence:** [docs/features/super-intelligence.md](docs/features/super-intelligence.md) — requires `DOME_API_KEY` (Polymarket) + AI provider keys (`XAI_API_KEY` and/or `OPENAI_API_KEY`). DFlow API is used automatically for Kalshi (no key required). Optional: `POLYFACTUAL_API_KEY` for Polyfactual tool. For Autonomous mode: `POLYMARKET_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` + `POLYMARKET_PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS`.
> - **Betting Bots:** [docs/features/betting-bots.md](docs/features/betting-bots.md) — requires `POLYMARKET_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` + `POLYMARKET_PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS`
> - **Wallet Tracking:** [docs/features/wallet-tracking.md](docs/features/wallet-tracking.md) — requires `DOME_API_KEY` (frontend only, no Supabase needed)

Example for Super Intelligence (full setup):

```env
# Market Data Providers
DOME_API_KEY=your_dome_api_key              # Get from https://dashboard.domeapi.io (for Polymarket)
# Note: DFlow API is used automatically for Kalshi markets (no API key required)

# AI Providers (configure one or both)
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key                # Get from https://x.ai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key          # Get from https://platform.openai.com

# Polyfactual Tool (optional, enables Polyfactual research tool)
POLYFACTUAL_API_KEY=your_polyfactual_key    # Contact Polyfactual to obtain

# Autonomous Mode (optional, for auto-execution on Polymarket)
POLYMARKET_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...         # Your wallet private key
POLYMARKET_PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...       # Your Polymarket proxy wallet
```

> 💡 **Note:** See the setup guides linked above for detailed instructions on obtaining each API key and configuration.

Start the Supabase services:

```bash
supabase start
```

Once running, get your local credentials (you'll need these for the frontend):

```bash
supabase status
```

This will display your `API URL` and `anon key` — save these for the next step.

Now start the Edge Functions server (keep this running):

```bash
supabase functions serve --env-file .env.local
```

### 3. Start the Frontend (Terminal)

Open a **new** terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to terminal directory
cd terminal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with credentials from `supabase status`:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=<API URL from supabase status>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key from supabase status>

# Edge Function URLs (for local development)
# Note that the base url might vary depending on `supabase status`:

# Super Intelligence endpoints
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_GET_EVENTS=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/get-events
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_EVENT_ANALYSIS_AGENT=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/event-analysis-agent
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_BOOKMAKER_AGENT=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/bookmaker-agent
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_MAPPER_AGENT=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/mapper-agent
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_POLYMARKET_PUT_ORDER=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/polymarket-put-order
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_POLYFACTUAL_RESEARCH=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/polyfactual-research

# Betting Bots endpoint
SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_BETTING_BOT=http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/polymarket-up-down-15-markets
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your PredictOS terminal will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
